                    <p>Sense Solutions was a team project that I undertook in Glasgow Caledonian University, alongside 4 other students.</p>
                    <p>Our project aimed to help people choose an outfite without having to get out of bed. The application created a table in a database for the user and allowed them to add, edit and remove entries.</p>
                    <p> The entries were articles of clothing that the user owned. Once the user finished inputing their articles of clothing into the application, the user was able to group the various entries and create outfits.</p>
                    <p>This project was based in Android Studio. However, I do not have access to the files. </p>

                    <p>During my time in university I completed the third year and started the fourth year to achieve an Honours degree. However this was when Covid began, resulting in me not completing the last year.</p>
                    <p>University taught me more about being a Project Manager and Cloud Computing. It offered challanges which I completed with no issue.</p>

                    <p>Instead of going straight into an university, I decided to take the first two years in a College, where I learned more about programming and managing hardware.</p>
                    <p>These two years were important as they taught me project management and the various strategies, such as Agile, Waterfall, e.t.c.</p>
                    <p>During the second year, I took an optional unit which rewarded me with a higher national 5 in Mathematics. </p>
